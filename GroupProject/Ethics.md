# Ethics

## What is ethics?

Ethics is a branch of philosophy that looks at actions of individuals in society, and whether those actions are morally right or wrong. It's not the same as following the law of the country you reside in. Those laws are born from ethical standards accepted by a group of people, usually of the same ethnicity. Their moral standards can be influenced by a number of things, whether it be religious background or culture.


Ethics also isn't blindly accepting what society deems acceptable. Those standards can still deviate from what is ethical. If ethics were determined by whatever society deems acceptable, you'd have to find out what society thinks when debating an ethical dilemma.

## Ethics in software engineering

When it comes to technology and even more specifically software engineering, ethics come into play in different aspects of software development. That can be during the development itself, the handling of user data or communication with everyone involved like: customers, colleagues or the end users.

Some of the guidelines from the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct:

-   Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.

-   Avoid harm.

-   Be honest and trustworthy.

-   Be fair and take action not to discriminate.

-   Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts.

-   Respect privacy.

-   Honor confidentiality.
