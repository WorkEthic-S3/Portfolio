# Culture

## What is culture? 

Culture is a term for shared beliefs, values, norms, laws and more within a group of people. These are learned through a process of socialization. Culture mostly originates from a specific region/location. 

Each culture has a standard of acceptable behavior which is unique to it's own. It tells people how to behave, think, speak among other things in a way that is acceptable to that society. When two cultures meet there may be some exchanges of cultural aspects, so groups of people that have lived close to each other may have similiar cultural aspects.

When meeting or working with someone from a vastly different culture, there may be differences in behaviour or overall demeanor. In some cultures people are more open than in other cultures, or in some cultures people might tend to speak louder. This can cause some issues when two people from cultures with different acceptable social behaviours meet. One might see a specific action as rude or inconsiderate, while the other person won't see anything wrong with it.

## Which are well-known dimensions on cultural differences? 

Geert Hofstede was a dutch social psychologist who was known for his research on cross-cultural groups/organizations. He developed a framework for cross-cultural communication called `Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory`. it intends to show how the values of a society's members are affected by that society's culture. 

The original theory proposed four dimensions: 
### Individualism-collectivism 

Individualism/collectivism is a dimension that is the degree to which people are seperated into groups. An individualist society is a society in which relations between individuals are very loose. People are expected to mostly look after themselves and their immediate family.

In collectivist societies individuals have a tight bond with the people around them, and are in close tight-knit groups. People will look after themselves but also parents and other extended family like uncles, aunts and grandparents, in exchange for loyalty.

A society's position between individualism and collectivism can only be measure *relative* to other societies.


### Uncertainty avoidance

Uncertainty avoidance is a society's willingness to face uncertain situations. It shows to what extend a culture tells it's members to be comfortable or uncomfortable in uncertainty. Uncertainty avoiding cultures try to minimize that uncertainty by bringing introducing rules, laws and security measures. 

Planning is also a part of avoiding uncertainty. Trying to follow a pre-made plan step-by-step shows effort to avoid the surprising, unknown aspects of uncertain istuations. This can be felt in some societies as some societies rely on laws and rules.

### Power distance

Power distance measures the acceptance of a hierarchy of power and wealth in a society or organisation. It's a concept used to understand the relationship between individuals of varying power and authority. Countries that score high on the power distance index, have a hierarchy that is more clearly defined and present. The communication may not be as close as that of a society that scores low on the index. The relationship is going to seem more authoritarian when compared to lower ranking societies.

Societies that score low on the index, have a more relaxed hierarchy between individuals. They tend to want to distribute power equally. People will more often challenge authority in the hopes to influence decisions that are made.

### Masculinity-femininity

Masculinity-femininity focuses on to which extend a society cares more about personal/material achievements, toughness, differentiated gender roles or modesty, caring for the weak and fluid gender roles.

A culture that is more masculine has more distinct gender roles. Males are supposed to be tough, focused on material success, while the women are more modest, soft-spoken and should care about the quality of life.

In a culture that is more feminine, both the males and the females can be modest and care about quality of life. The gender roles are also blurred in these societies.

Later on he added two new dimensions: 

### Long-term vs short-term orientation

This dimension shows whether a culture is more focused long-term (future) or short term (present). It shows differences in how societies will tackles challenges of the present and future.

Societies that score high, so that are long-term oriented, are more focused on the future and it's challenges and act accordingly. People from these societies care less about leisure time and activities that bring instant gradification. They prepare for the future and tend to think in a "we" way instead of "I". These societies encourage innovation and adaptation. Cultures that are long-term oriented value persistence/perseverance. They'll stick to something even if it's incredibly difficult, because they believe it will pay off in the end.

On the other hand, societies that score low, so that are short-term oriented, care more about the present than the future. They'll for example, spend money, value tradition and live for the moment. These societies will look at change and innovation with suspicion. People think more in a "I" way instead of "we". Relationships are ordered less by status. Which means that people don't have the same type of respect for people with a higher position than them, than someone in a long-term oriented society would for someone like that.

### Indulgence vs self-restraint

Indulgent societies allow relatively free gratification of basic and natural human tendencies, that are related to enjoying life and having fun. For them having fun and fulfilling desires is considered normal.

Societies that are more restraint don't value having fun the same way. Life is considered hard and enjoying life isn't encouraged. These societies care more about work and duty rather than personal gradification. That is why countries that are restraint tend to develop at a faster pace. 

## My experience with cultural differences with others

### Different cultures

During the first semester I followed the Course-Based path which is international. Around more than half of my class had a different nationality, most from European countries like Bulgaria, Belarus and Latvia, but also some from Africa.

I had a great experience working with them, although you could see differences when we were working in groups together. A lot of them were very talkative and open. That's not a bad thing, but I'm the exact opposite, a more closed and quiet individual. Some common cultural aspects due to historical events only multiplied their openness causing their willingness to talk to me to increase like we had known each other for a long time. 

That only improved our groupwork because the group started to connect more and we could communicate better. So in this case the cultural difference didn't have any real negative consequences.

### Different personalities

During my second and third semester I followed the Demand-Based path, because I felt like that fit more with my way of studying. Another difference is that Demand-Based has no/less international students. Which may mean that culture is more similiar, but that doesn't negate the fact that personalities may vary drastically. In our current group we also have varying personalities.

That can mean the way people handle deadlines, some people (like me) may work on something long before a deadline, but others don't mind fixing some things a day before, or atleast very close to a deadline. I would rather be mostly done with a task so I won't have any last minute stress about an issue popping up last minute.

People also tend to differ when it comes to communication. I'd rather get occasional updates on how tasks are going and whether issues are popping up so we can take care of them ASAP, instead of hearing nothing and discussing everything at once. You can tell that not everyone has the same idea of communication. It has happened before that I messaged someone about a thing, and I'd get no reply back or a very late one. Those have been mentioned and was acknowledged, people are willing to change some habits if it'll improve the progress of the team and our work.
