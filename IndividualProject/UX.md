# How to determine the quality of the UX for my project?

## Pleasure

When all points mentioned above are in place, the user has a good time using your product. Which is what you aim to achieve when designing your UX. You don’t want the user to leave with a bad taste in their mouth after using your application. There is a chance they’ll go looking somewhere else and not come back. There should be some pleasure when using your service to increase the chances of users coming back.

The user doesn’t have to put in effort to be able to use your product. Finding their way around your application and performing certain tasks should take as little effort as possible. If the UX is designed well, there’s little room for users making mistakes. The application will seaminglessly guide the user through the process without them really noticing.
